# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Matthias Moulin](https://matt77hias.github.io), a [Digital Illusionist](https://www.dice.se) rendering [electronic arts](https://www.ea.com) while [biting frost](https://www.ea.com/frostbite) in Sweden. I primarily work as a rendering software engineer at the Image Quality cell of the Frostbite Rendering group and contribute to various [EA game franchises](https://www.ea.com/frostbite/games). Furthermore, I am also a dedicated rendering software engineer at [EA DICE](https://www.dice.se/games).

In my spare time, I contribute to my own game and rendering engine, [MAGE](https://github.com/matt77hias/MAGE) ðŸ§™.

I am passionate about C++ and computer graphics, and overall, interested in many computer science, mathematics and physics subdomains.
If you want to reach out or just like to say *hi*, my DM's are open and I actually read and respond to messages.
