# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matthias Moulin, [Digital Illusionist](https://www.dice.se/) rendering [electronic arts](https://www.ea.com/) while [biting frost](https://www.ea.com/frostbite) in Sweden. I primarily work as a rendering software engineer at the Image Quality cell of the Frostbite Rendering group and contribute to various EA game franchises. Furthermore, I am also a dedicated rendering software engineer at EA DICE.

I am passionate about C++ and computer graphics.
